cpdef dict parse_savefile(str sfs, bint sfs_is_path=True):
    """Parses an SFS file

    Params:
        sfs: str; the path to the SFS file to read or a string containing data read from an sfs.
        sfs_is_path (optional, default True): bool; whether the 'sfs' param is a path or raw data.
    Raises:
        No specific exceptions.
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing the data in the SFS.
    Extra information:
        All values are strings as SFS files do not reveal data to be any type.
        The SFS format is particularly bad and this leads to the returned dictionary
        containing data that is unusually structured. If the SFS contains multiple keys of any
        kind with the same name (this can be a 'node' header or values in a node), then the data
        contained within these keys will formatted as the common name of the keys as a key
        in a dict, and the values as a list. This data will always be in the exact order
        that they were in in the SFS (dictionaries are ordered in python3.6+). Example:

        --SFS format--
        NODE
        {
            x = 1
            x = 2
            y = 3
        }
        NODE
        {
            value = 1
        }
        OTHER
        {
            z = 4
        }

        --Python structure--
        {
            "NODE": [
                {"x": ["1","2"], "y": "3"},
